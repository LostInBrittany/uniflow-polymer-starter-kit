# Polymer Uniflow Starter Kit

This template is a starting point for building apps using the 
[UniFlow for Polymer pattern](https://github.com/google/uniflow-polymer) with a 
drawer-based layout. The layout is provided by `app-layout` elements.

This template, along with the `polymer-cli` toolchain, also demonstrates use
of the "PRPL pattern" This pattern allows fast first delivery and interaction with
the content at the initial route requested by the user, along with fast subsequent
navigation by pre-caching the remaining components required by the app and
progressively loading them on-demand as the user navigates through the app.

The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand

### Migrating from Polymer Starter Kit v1?

[Check out our blog post that covers what's changed in PSK2 and how to migrate!](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-08-18-polymer-starter-kit-or-polymer-cli.html)

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open

### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

    polymer build

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled

### Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    polymer test

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the
application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of
`fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those
components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components
and will be included in the `bundled` build.
